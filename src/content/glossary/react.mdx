React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Key Concepts

- **Components**: Reusable UI building blocks that encapsulate their own state and logic
- **JSX**: JavaScript syntax extension that looks like HTML and describes what the UI should look like
- **Virtual DOM**: An efficient abstraction layer that minimizes direct manipulation of the actual DOM
- **Hooks**: Functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components

## Example

```jsx
function Welcome({ name }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Clicked {count} times
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## When to Use

React is ideal for:
- Single-page applications (SPAs)
- Complex, interactive user interfaces
- Applications requiring frequent UI updates
- Projects benefiting from a large ecosystem and community
