Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization technology. It enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

## Key Features

- **Containerization**: Package applications with all their dependencies into standardized units
- **Portability**: Run consistently across development, testing, and production environments
- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own isolated environment
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight compared to VMs

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t myapp .

# Run a container
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop <container_id>
```

## Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Use Cases

Docker is commonly used for:
- Microservices architecture
- Continuous integration/deployment pipelines
- Development environment standardization
- Application isolation and security
