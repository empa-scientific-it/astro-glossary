An API (Application Programming Interface) defines how software components should interact. In web development, APIs typically refer to web services that enable communication between a client and server, or between different services.

## Types of Web APIs

### REST APIs
Representational State Transfer APIs use standard HTTP methods and are stateless.

```javascript
// GET request example
const response = await fetch('/api/users/123');
const user = await response.json();
```

### GraphQL APIs
A query language for APIs that lets clients request exactly what they need.

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

### WebSocket APIs
Enable real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server.

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.example.com/live');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Received:', event.data);
};
```

## Best Practices

- **Versioning**: Include version in the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/users`)
- **Consistent naming**: Use nouns for resources, verbs via HTTP methods
- **Error handling**: Return meaningful error codes and messages
- **Documentation**: Provide clear, up-to-date API documentation
- **Authentication**: Implement proper auth (OAuth, API keys, JWT)

## Common HTTP Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| GET | Retrieve resources |
| POST | Create new resources |
| PUT | Update existing resources |
| PATCH | Partial update |
| DELETE | Remove resources |
